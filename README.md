# Node Practice
Basic command line application to practice with Node and its related API's.

### Functionality
* __app.js__ and __profile.js__
  * When calling `node app.js *username list*`, the command line application performs a get request to an API and returns each user's badges.
  * There is thorough error checking at each stage in the API call (checking for improper URL's, usernames, or server issues).
